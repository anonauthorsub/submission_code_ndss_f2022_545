# Rust implementation of a VKD

This repository contains anonymized versions of code used for NDSS Submission #545.

The code for various experiments and graphs is organized as follows:

1. `vkd_ozks`: Code for a Parakeet implementation which uses an oZKS.
2. `vkd_azks_seemless`: Code for a VKD implementation that uses an aZKS, which makes it equivalent to (SEEMless)[https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/607.pdf].
